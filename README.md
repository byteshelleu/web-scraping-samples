## Common Design Principles

All projects in this repository follow these core principles:
- No try/except blocks for flow control
- Cognitive complexity kept under 15
- Centralized locators
- Explicit waits
- Clean, modular code structure
- Instance methods over static methods

## Getting Started

Each project has its own README with specific instructions for running and configuring the scraper.

## Requirements
